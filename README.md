  <h1> About </h1>
<h2> My name is Aaron and I cut hair. I've been cutting for 9 months now and I've cut over 30 people so I'm kind of experienced. I cut all hair types and do plenty of hairstyles. </h2>

<h3> Why I started </h3>
<h4>My mom used to cut my hair so we would have haircut tools at my house. One day, my friend Benjamin had terrible hair and with no experienced I offered to cut his hair. With no experience, I just did it over 1 hour and 40 min for my first time on the first day of Winter Break. That day started it all. </h4>
